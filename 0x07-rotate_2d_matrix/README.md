a Python function named rotate_2d_matrix that rotates a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The function takes a 2D matrix as input and modifies it in-place to store the rotated matrix.

The function starts by creating an empty list called rotated_matrix to store the rotated matrix. It then iterates over the columns of the input matrix using a for loop with the range function. The range function is a built-in Python function that returns a sequence of numbers. In this case, it is used to generate a sequence of indices corresponding to the columns of the matrix.

Inside the loop, a new row is created for each column using an inner for loop. This inner loop iterates over the rows of the input matrix using another range function. For each row, the corresponding element from the column is appended to the new_row list using the append method.
Once all the elements of a column have been appended to the new_row list, the list is reversed using the [::-1] slicing syntax. This reverses the order of the elements in the list, effectively rotating the column 90 degrees clockwise.

The new_row list, representing a rotated column, is then appended to the rotated_matrix list. This process is repeated for each column of the input matrix, resulting in a fully rotated matrix stored in the rotated_matrix list.

Finally, the original matrix is updated by assigning the contents of the rotated_matrix list to it using the slice assignment matrix[:] = rotated_matrix. This ensures that the original matrix is modified in-place.

Overall, the rotate_2d_matrix function uses nested loops to iterate over the elements of the input matrix and construct a new matrix that is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The function modifies the original matrix in-place to store the rotated matrix.
