The selected code is a Python function named island_perimeter that calculates the perimeter of an island described in a grid. The function takes a single parameter grid, which represents the island as a 2D grid of 0s and 1s.

The function starts by initializing a variable count to 0, which will keep track of the perimeter. It then iterates over each row and column in the grid using nested for loops. For each cell in the grid, it checks if the value is 1, indicating land.

If the cell value is 1, the function increments the count by 4, as each land cell contributes 4 sides to the perimeter.

Next, the function checks if there is a neighboring land cell above the current cell (row - 1) and to the left of the current cell (col - 1). If there is, it subtracts 2 from the count because the shared side between the current cell and its neighbor should not be counted as part of the perimeter.

Finally, the function returns the calculated count, which represents the perimeter of the island.

This implementation efficiently calculates the perimeter of the island by iterating over each cell in the grid only once. By considering the neighboring cells, it correctly handles the shared sides between adjacent land cells.
It's worth noting that the function assumes the input grid is valid and represents a single island. If the grid contains multiple islands, the function will calculate the perimeter of the entire grid, including the shared sides between different islands.
