This Python script is designed to process log files. It reads lines from the standard input, parses each line to extract certain information, and then prints out statistics about the processed logs.

The parse_line function is used to parse a single line of the log. It splits the line into parts, and then attempts to extract the IP address, status code, and file size from those parts. The IP address is assumed to be the first part of the line, the status code is assumed to be the second to last part, and the file size is assumed to be the last part. If the line doesn't have enough parts or if the status code and file size aren't valid integers, the function returns None for all three values.

The print_stats function is used to print out the current statistics. It prints the total file size and the count of each status code encountered so far. The status codes are printed in sorted order.
The process_logs function is the main function of the script. It initializes the total file size and the status code counts to zero, and then reads lines from the standard input. For each line, it strips off any leading or trailing whitespace, parses the line, and then updates the total file size and status code counts. If the line couldn't be parsed, it is skipped. Every 10 lines, it prints out the current statistics. If the script is interrupted with a keyboard interrupt, it also prints out the current statistics.

The int class is a built-in Python class for integer numbers. It provides methods for basic arithmetic operations, bitwise operations, comparisons, and conversions to other types.

The enumerate class is a built-in Python class that provides an iterator yielding pairs of an index and a value for each item in a given iterable. It is used in the process_logs function to keep track of how many lines have been processed so far.
