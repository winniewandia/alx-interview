This Python script reads from the standard input (stdin), processes the input line by line, and computes certain metrics. The metrics it computes are the total size of the data read and the count of each HTTP status code encountered.

The display_metrics function is defined to print the metrics. It takes two arguments: file_size which is the total size of the data read so far, and status_counts which is a dictionary containing the count of each status code read so far. The function first prints the file size, then it iterates over the keys of the status_counts dictionary in sorted order, printing each key and its corresponding value.

The main part of the script is enclosed in a if __name__ == "__main__": block, which ensures that this code is only executed if the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module. It initializes several variables, including total_size to keep track of the total size of the data read, status_counts to keep track of the count of each status code, valid_statuses which is a list of valid HTTP status codes, and line_count to keep track of the number of lines read.
The script then enters a try block where it reads from stdin line by line in a loop. For each line, it increments line_count. If line_count reaches 10, it calls display_metrics to print the metrics computed so far and resets line_count to 0.

Next, it splits the line into parts using the split method. It tries to add the last part of the line (assumed to be the size of the data in the line) to total_size. If this fails (because the line doesn't have a last part or it is not a valid integer), it skips the rest of the loop and goes to the next line.

It then tries to get the second last part of the line (assumed to be the status code). If the status code is in the list of valid statuses, it increments the count for that status code in status_counts. If this fails (because the line doesn't have a second last part), it skips the rest of the loop and goes to the next line.
After the loop, it calls display_metrics one more time to print the final metrics. If a KeyboardInterrupt exception is raised (which happens when the user presses Ctrl+C), it also calls display_metrics to print the metrics before re-raising the exception.
