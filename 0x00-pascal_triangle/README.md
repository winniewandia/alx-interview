The provided Python function pascal_triangle(n) generates the first n rows of Pascal's Triangle. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients, where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

The function takes an integer n as input. If n is less than or equal to 0, the function returns an empty list, as there are no rows to generate.

If n is greater than 0, the function initializes result as a list containing a single list [1], which represents the first row of Pascal's Triangle.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (exclusive). For each iteration i, it creates a new row starting with the number 1. It then enters a nested loop that iterates from 1 to i (exclusive). For each iteration j in the nested loop, it appends the sum of the j-1th and jth elements from the previous row (result[i-1]) to the current row. After the nested loop, it appends 1 to the end of the current row, and then appends the current row to result.

Finally, the function returns result, which is a list of lists representing the first n rows of Pascal's Triangle.

The append method of the list class is used to add elements to the end of a list. The range class is used to generate sequences of numbers, which are used as the iteration variables in the loops.
